        <h3>About the team!</h3>
        <h4 <span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>  Aoba Johsai High or also known as Seijoh, is one of the strongest volleyball teams in the Miyagi Prefecture.
        Seijoh is known for their amazing teamwork, strategy, and skill set. The team is led by their talented setter and captain, T≈çru Oikawa. His leadership, precision, and  need for perfection pushes his teammates to 
        perform at their best. With players like Iwaizumi Hajime as their vice-captain and ace wing spiker, he provides strength and stability through his powerful spikes and strong mentality. He also acts as a supporting pillar and the 
        level-headed or calm person of the team, contrary to Oikawa's recklessness because of his need to me a "genius". Aoba Johsai's playing style focuses on coordination, quick attacks, and of course, adaptability on the court.
        Despite facing tough opponents like Inarizaki, Shiratorizawa, Date Tech, and more, they still prevail to be a strong team because of their determination, unity, and respect for the court and the game, they have become
        a respected team on and off the court. </h4>
